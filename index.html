        <p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700
            (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer
            material
            (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard,
            which
            is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands
            to
            cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p>

            <p>The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments. Pipe organs have been used since
                antiquity, and as such, the development of pipe organs enabled instrument builders to learn about creating keyboard
                mechanisms for sounding pitches. The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers,which
                were used since the Middle Ages in Europe. During the Middle Ages, there were several attempts at creating stringed
                keyboard instruments with struck strings. By the 17th century, the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the
                clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed. In a clavichord, the strings are struck by tangents, while in a
                harpsichord, they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key. Centuries of work on the
                mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown instrument builders the most effective ways to construct the case,
                soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings.</p>
            <p>
            The invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655â€“1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by
            Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments.Cristofori was an expert
            harpsichord maker, and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments; this knowledge
            of keyboard mechanisms and actions helped him to develop the first pianos. It is not known exactly when Cristofori first
            built a piano. An inventory made by his employers, the Medici family, indicates the existence of a piano by the year
            1700. The three Cristofori pianos that survive today date from the 1720s.Cristofori named the instrument un
            cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte ("a keyboard of cypress with soft and loud"), abbreviated over time as pianoforte,
            fortepiano, and later, simply, piano.
